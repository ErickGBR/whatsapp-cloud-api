# ü§ñ WhatsApp Cloud API Integration

## Description

This repository contains the necessary code and documentation for integration with the **WhatsApp Cloud API**. This project facilitates the **programmatic sending and receiving of messages** on the WhatsApp platform, utilizing Meta's secure and scalable cloud infrastructure. It is designed to help businesses and developers build robust applications for customer support, notifications, and interactive conversations with users globally.

The integration aims to be a robust, scalable, and easy-to-implement solution, managing authentication, webhook configuration, message templates, and message handling logic.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Secure Authentication:** Uses **Access Tokens** for secure API calls.
* **Message Sending:** Supports sending various types of messages, including **text, multimedia (images, documents), and message templates**.
* **Webhook Receiver:** Includes a server implementation (e.g., **Node.js/Express**, **Python/Flask**) to receive **real-time message updates** and **status notifications** (delivered, read, failed).
* **Template Management:** Shows how to use **pre-approved message templates** to start conversations outside the 24-hour customer service window.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to be deployed on cloud platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud) and handle high volume traffic.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your WhatsApp Cloud API project up and running.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following to get started:

1.  A **Meta Developer Account**.
2.  A **Meta App** configured for the WhatsApp platform.
3.  A **Phone Number ID** and a **Business Account ID** from your Meta App Dashboard.
4.  A **Permanent Access Token** (for production environments).
5.  A local development environment (e.g., **Node.js**, **Python**, **PHP** installed).
6.  A tunneling service like **ngrok** to expose your local webhook endpoint to the internet (for testing).

### Installation and Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
    cd [YOUR_REPO_NAME]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Example for a Node.js project)*
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(Example for a Python project)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your credentials:
    ```
    # Replace with your actual values
    ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_WHATSAPP_CLOUD_API_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    PHONE_NUMBER_ID="YOUR_WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID"
    VERIFY_TOKEN="YOUR_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN"
    PORT=3000
    ```

4.  **Start the Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start # or python app.py
    ```

5.  **Configure Webhooks (to receive messages):**
    * Start your tunneling service (e.g., `ngrok http 3000`).
    * Take the **HTTPS URL** provided by ngrok.
    * In the Meta App Dashboard ‚Üí WhatsApp ‚Üí Configuration, set the **Webhook Callback URL** to your ngrok URL plus the webhook route (e.g., `https://[YOUR_NGROK_ID].ngrok-free.app/webhook`).
    * Set the **Verify Token** to the one you defined in your `.env` file.
